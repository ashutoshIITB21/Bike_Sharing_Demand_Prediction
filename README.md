# Bike_Sharing_Demand_Prediction

## Data Description:
### The dataset contains weather information (Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Visibility, Dewpoint, Solar radiation, Snowfall, Rainfall), the number of bikes rented per hour and date information.

 ## Conclusions:

‚óè We started with loading the data, then we did Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), null values treatment, feature selection, encoding of categorical columns, and then model building. In all of these models, our accuracy ranges from 56% to 91%, which can be said to be good for such a large dataset. This performance could be due to various reasons like the proper pattern of data, large data, or because of the relevant features.
